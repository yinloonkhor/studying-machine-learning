# Studying Machine Learning
A documentation of my machine learning journey learning the fundamentals and required skills to build a good portfolio. ML is always my interest and I build this repository to document them down and sharing good resources! I believe Internet has sufficient resources to learn anything we want. Probably building some interesting projects in the future.

A good roadmap as reference: https://github.com/farukalamai/advanced-machine-learning-engineer-roadmap-2024

## a) Machine Learning Fundamentals
### [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)<br/>
Three courses are included in this series, covering:
- supervised learning: regression and classification,
- advanced learning algorithms and
- unsupervised learning, recommenders and reinforcement learning.

Deeplearning.ai offers comprehensive AI courses to learn with Andrew Ng to teach the concepts using Python. I would recommend going through this series to get a fundamental understanding of ML. Understanding the math behind is a very important step. The quizzes and assignments can be obtained from [here](https://github.com/greyhatguy007/Machine-Learning-Specialization-Coursera).</br></br>

## b) Transformer Architecture
### [Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs8w1Cdi-zvYskDS2icIItfZgxclApVLv)<br/>
I found this video series from this [guide](https://github.com/louisfb01/start-machine-learning?tab=readme-ov-file) and it explains attention mechanism in another perspective for easy understanding. However, you may need another video to understand about encoder and decoder as a complete transformer architecture. 

### [Illustrated Guide to Transformers Neural Network: A step by step explanation](https://youtu.be/4Bdc55j80l8?si=lgsvisn2ZmD2rczz)<br/>
This video explains the transformer architecture as a whole, covering the missing aspects in the previous video.

## c) Training LLM
### [Generative AI with Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms)<br/>
Now, after learning about the basics of transformer architecture, I would recommend to make your hands dirty by trying this course. This course is a collaboration between deeplearning.ai and AWS, so the labs are conducted using AWS SageMaker (similar to Google Colab).
This course offers three modules, including:
- generative AI use cases, project lifecycle, and model pre-training,
- fine-tuning and evaluating large language models and
- reinforcement learning and LLM-powered applications.

The labs can be obtained [here](https://github.com/Ryota-Kawamura/Generative-AI-with-LLMs/tree/main). I started to love deeplearning.ai for such amazing courses.

## d) Diffusion Models
For this area, I use YouTube as the primary source of learning.
- How diffusion models work - explanation and code!: [Link](https://youtu.be/I1sPXkm2NH4?si=qOmqWP95uc38kL9_)
- ðŸ¤” Ok, but what IS ControlNet?: [Link](https://youtu.be/fhIGt7QGg4w?si=vQXO7eUa6rl4DVoy) (An extension of stable diffusion)
- Variational Autoencoder - Model, ELBO, loss function and maths explained easily!: [Link](https://youtu.be/iwEzwTTalbg?si=ie4hhVgJd0iWgGsr) (A key component of stable diffusion)

## e) Others
- DeepSeek R1 Theory Overview | GRPO + RL + SFT: [Link](https://youtu.be/QdEuh2UVbu0?si=TgYZqkqZRr2nEWLL)
- Stanford Univ CREATED the S1 Reasoning LLM (o1, R1): [Link](https://youtu.be/3tM3yc9UI84?si=CZ9LjOShcELdC4kk)

## Projects
After learning these knowledge, I think it's time to get my hands dirty by trying some projects. My current idea is a specialized LLM for technical knowledge retrieval and reasoning which will be updated in another repo. Stay tuned!
