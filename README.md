# Studying Machine Learning
A documentation of my machine learning journey learning the fundamentals and required skills to build a good portfolio.

A good roadmap as reference: https://github.com/farukalamai/advanced-machine-learning-engineer-roadmap-2024

## a) Machine Learning Fundamentals
### [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)<br/>
Three courses are included in this series, covering:
- supervised learning: regression and classification,
- advanced learning algorithms and
- unsupervised learning, recommenders and reinforcement learning.

Deeplearning.ai offers comprehensive AI courses to learn with Andrew Ng to teach the concepts using Python. I would recommend going through this series to get a fundamental understanding of ML. Understanding the math behind is a very important step. The quizzes and assignments can be obtained from [here](https://github.com/greyhatguy007/Machine-Learning-Specialization-Coursera) with the notes [here](https://github.com/julianyulu/Machine-Learning-Notes?tab=readme-ov-file#last-update).

## b) Transformer Architecture
### [Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs8w1Cdi-zvYskDS2icIItfZgxclApVLv)<br/>
I found this video series from this [guide](https://github.com/louisfb01/start-machine-learning?tab=readme-ov-file) and it explains attention mechanism in another perspective for easy understanding. However, you may need another video to understand about encoder and decoder as a complete transformer architecture. 

### [Illustrated Guide to Transformers Neural Network: A step by step explanation](https://youtu.be/4Bdc55j80l8?si=lgsvisn2ZmD2rczz)<br/>
This video explains the transformer architecture as a whole, covering the missing aspects in the previous video.

## c) Training LLM
[Generative AI with Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms)<br/>
Now, after learning about the basics of transformer architecture, I would recommend to make your hands dirty by trying this course. This course is a collaboration between deeplearning.ai and AWS, so the labs are conducted using AWS SageMaker (similar to Google Colab).
This course offers three modules, including:
- generative AI use cases, project lifecycle, and model pre-training,
- fine-tuning and evaluating large language models and
- reinforcement learning and LLM-powered applications.

The labs can be obtained [here](https://github.com/Ryota-Kawamura/Generative-AI-with-LLMs/tree/main). I started to love deeplearning.ai for such amazing courses.
